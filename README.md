# Technical Specification:
1. JUnit
2. Java 17
3. Cucumber
4. Selenium
5. SLF4J and logback are used for better logging
6. Extent Reports
7. Driver Manager
8. Maven Plugins

# Highlights:
1.  POM(Page object model)
2.  Gherkin is used for quality BDD scenarios
3.  Hooks are implemented for better code management
4.  POM.xml is used for better dependency management
5.  Profiles are used for browser and environment
6.  Checkstyle.xml is added to define coding standards, enforcing consistencyand to improve code quality.
7.  Extent Reports are added for rich and visual test reports, historical trend analysis and detailed logging.
8.  WebDriver Manager is used for dynamic webDriver initialization,browser configuration etc.
9.  For web scrapping- There were 2 options where first is Selenium webdriver and second is JSoup. Used selenium webdriver for now as per problem statement.
10. Jenkins file is added in generic form for the purpose of complete framework.
11. For the ease of determining test failure(s) reason- tagging, custom assertions, snapshots for failure, hooks and detailed report is added.
12. For better Code quality and maintainability - both the design automation code and the organization of project is followed.

#Also, added javadoc and comments whereever possible for better understanding of code

# Select profile for easy browser access from maven profiles
